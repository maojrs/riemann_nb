    "A brief intuitive derivation of the acoustics equations is presented. We derive the normal Riemann solver for one and two dimensional acoustics and the transverse Riemann solver for two dimensional acoustics in a cartesian grid. These solvers are further extended for general quadrilateral mapped grids. Along some of these examples, we will show how to use PyClaw to solve the acoustics equations."

For instance, in the plot below we show the phase plane where the pressure $p$ corresponds to the $x$ axis and the velocity $u$ corresponds to the $y$ axis. In this plot, the initial left and right states $q_L$ and $q_M$ are points in the plane as well as the new middle state $q_M$. We show the phase plane for some specific parameters. The eigenvector directions are shown in the bottom of the interactive plot. The location of the middle state in the phase plane is obtain by the intersection of the parallelogram created by the eigenvectors and the initial states, which of the two intersections will depend on the location of the initial states. The solution will always move from $q_L$ to $q_M$ in the direction of its corresponding eigenvector $\\bar{r_1}$ and the to $q_R$ in the direction of $\\bar{r_2}$.
